We think it's pretty awesome, even with its warts. We _don't_ think it stands up to commercial software standards. But we like cooking and making our own lives easier, so there it is. Have an opinion? Submit a PR! If you have code, that's awesome. If you don't, that's also awesome! Ideas are always the hard part. Coding them up isn't always simple, but it's usually easier than the "people" problems.
